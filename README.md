modbus4j-nologging
==================
This is a stripped down version of modbus4j. The main feature removed is logging. I did this to get rid of the org.apache.* libraries that are not included in Android.

This is the contents of the original README.md:

A high-performance and ease-of-use implementation of the Modbus protocol written in Java by Infinite Automation Systems and Serotonin Software. Supports ASCII, RTU, TCP, and UDP transports as slave or master, automatic request partitioning and response data type parsing.
